Raised when an operation iterates past the valid input range.

  This exception is raised in "end-of-file" conditions, such as when a
  [`queue.dequeue()`](../../api_docs/python/io_ops.md#QueueBase.dequeue)
  operation is blocked on an empty queue, and a
  [`queue.close()`](../../api_docs/python/io_ops.md#QueueBase.close)
  operation executes.
