W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:975] Data loss: file is too short to be an sstable
Raised when unrecoverable data loss or corruption is encountered.

  For example, this may be raised by running a
  [`tf.WholeFileReader.read()`](../../api_docs/python/io_ops.md#WholeFileReader)
  operation, if the file is truncated while it is being read.
